# How to contribute

### Sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Even for small changes, we ask that you please sign the CLA electronically
[here](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual).
The CLA is necessary because you own the copyright to your changes, even
after your contribution becomes part of our codebase, so we need your permission
to use and distribute your code. You can find more details
[here](https://code.google.com/p/dart/wiki/Contributing).

Whenever you create a pull request, an automatic bot will check if you have
signed the CLA, if not, it will send instructions on how to do so.
